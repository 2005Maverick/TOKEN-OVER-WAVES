## Overview

Token over Waves is a cutting-edge deep learning framework designed to detect fake audio using a combination of advanced neural architectures and multi-modal analysis. The system integrates both waveform and spectrogram features, leveraging transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention to achieve robust and reliable audio authenticity detection. This project aims to address the growing challenge of audio forgeries by providing a transparent, explainable, and high-performing solution.

## System Architecture

### Model Overview

The architecture of Token over Waves is meticulously designed to capture both temporal and spectral characteristics of audio signals. The system is composed of the following components:

- **Audio Transformer Encoder:** This module processes raw waveform data, extracting temporal features that are crucial for distinguishing between real and fake audio. The encoder utilizes multi-head self-attention to model long-range dependencies in the audio signal.

- **Spectrogram Transformer Encoder:** By converting audio into mel spectrograms, this encoder focuses on frequency-based features. It applies transformer layers to capture patterns in the spectral domain, which are often indicative of synthetic manipulations.

- **Cross-Modal Attention:** This mechanism fuses the outputs of the waveform and spectrogram encoders, allowing the model to learn joint representations. Cross-modal attention ensures that the system can leverage complementary information from both domains, improving detection accuracy.

- **Emotional Coherence Decoder:** Fake audio often exhibits unnatural emotional patterns. This decoder analyzes the emotional trajectory of the audio, flagging inconsistencies that may indicate forgery.

- **Artifact Detector:** Synthetic audio may contain subtle artifacts or anomalies. This component is trained to identify such irregularities, further enhancing the system's robustness.

- **Classifier Head:** The final module aggregates all extracted features and makes the real/fake prediction, outputting a confidence score and additional analysis.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training Progress

During training, the model is optimized using a combination of supervised and self-supervised objectives. The training and validation loss curves below demonstrate the model's ability to learn meaningful representations and generalize to unseen data. A steady decrease in loss, followed by convergence, indicates successful training and minimal overfitting.

### Feature Analysis

#### t-SNE Feature Visualization

To better understand the model's internal representations, we use t-SNE to project high-dimensional features into two dimensions. The resulting plot reveals clear separation between real and fake audio samples, indicating that the model has learned discriminative features.

#### Emotional Coherence Distribution

This graph illustrates the distribution of emotional coherence scores across the dataset. Real audio typically exhibits smooth emotional transitions, while fake audio may show abrupt or unnatural changes. The model leverages these patterns to improve detection accuracy.

```python
from audio_detection import DeepfakeAudioDetectionSystem

detection_system = DeepfakeAudioDetectionSystem(
    data_dir='path/to/your/data',
    batch_size=32,
    num_workers=8,
    max_epochs=10
)
best_model_path = detection_system.train()
```

### Inference

To run inference on a new audio file:

```python
result = detection_system.predict('path/to/audio/file.wav')
print(f"Prediction: {result['prediction']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
print(f"Emotional Coherence: {result['emotional_coherence']:.2f}")
```
