# üéµ Token over Waves: Advanced Audio Processing System

## Overview

Token over Waves is a state-of-the-art deep learning system for detecting fake audio using transformer-based, multi-modal analysis. It leverages both waveform and spectrogram features, advanced attention mechanisms, and robust training strategies to achieve high accuracy in audio authenticity detection.

## System Architecture

### Model Overview

The architecture consists of several key components:

- **Audio Transformer Encoder:** Processes raw waveform data to extract temporal features.
- **Spectrogram Transformer Encoder:** Analyzes mel spectrograms for frequency-based features.
- **Cross-Modal Attention:** Fuses information from both modalities for richer representations.
- **Emotional Coherence Decoder:** Detects inconsistencies in emotional patterns.
- **Artifact Detector:** Identifies artificial artifacts in audio signals.
- **Classifier Head:** Makes the final real/fake prediction.
